## 🚀 Getting Started

Bring your video games to life with music and sound in just a few steps:

### 1. Open the Audio Creator
Go to **`Tools > Melenitas Dev > Sounds Good`** in the Unity menu.

### 2. Create Sounds or Music
- Add one or more audio clips.
- Assign a **tag** to identify them.
- Select the **compression preset** that best suits your audio (for better performance).
- If multiple clips are added, one will be chosen randomly at runtime to reduce repetition.

### 3. Reference in Code
Import the library and reference your audio using its tag or the autogenerated enum.

```csharp
using MelenitasDev.SoundsGood;

Sound jump = new Sound(SFX.Jump);
```

### 4. Customize It
Chain built-in methods to configure your sound:

```csharp
jump.SetLoop(true)
    .SetRandomPitch()
    .SetVolume(0.7f)
    .SetRandomClip()
    .SetFollowTarget(transform);
```

### 5. Play It!
Just call `.Play()` wherever you need it:

```csharp
jump.Play();
```
